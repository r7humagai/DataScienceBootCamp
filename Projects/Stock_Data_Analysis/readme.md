This project revolves around the comprehensive analysis of stock market data. It begins by cleaning and preprocessing the data, removing irrelevant entries such as weekends and federal holidays. The analysis includes the calculation and visualization of key indicators like Exponential Moving Averages (EMA), Simple Moving Averages (SMA), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Relative Strength Index (RSI), Bollinger Bands, and Average Directional Index (ADX). Additionally, it employs a Linear Regression model to predict stock closing prices using open, high, and low values. The project culminates in a multi-subplot visualization, offering insights into various aspects of stock market behavior and prediction accuracy.
